I am a <strong>Front End Web Developer</strong> with the University of Washington School of Law. I've also worked as a one-person design and web services shop under the name <a href="http://rookishdesign.com/"><strong>Rookish Design</strong></a>.
<h3>Fun projects</h3>
<a href="http://Ch-ch-changes.com">Ch-ch-changes</a> | Convert your text among any of six different styles, including camelCase (commonly used in JavaScript) and spinal-case (AKA kebab-case, commonly used in CSS).

<a href="http://codepen.io/denmch/full/ojvJoq/">Kompvtor</a> | This fake "terminal" is really a demo of a custom caret (text cursor). It responds to some basic commands and combines a few geeky references with the geekiest of art forms: ASCII art.

<a href="http://codepen.io/denmch/full/acEIA/">STIKHOI</a> | A method for displaying classical verse (e.g., Homer, Sappho, Horace) in HTML with proper line numbers and indentation (where applicable). [<a href="https://github.com/denmch/stikhoi">Github</a>]

<a href="http://wayback.archive.org/web/19990819130633/http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Lofts/4567/">Peyote Internet Theatre</a> | This is a Jeff Buckley tribute site I made before you were born. The Internet Archive saved the Geocities page as far as back as 1999, but I'm sure it existed in some form before Jeff died. I remember reaching out to a friend and photographer of Jeff's for permission to use some of the images I was already using (like every other tribute site), and the correspondence moved me to pull it all down out of respect. I wrote the In Memoriam and posted the the scans from the St. Ann's memorial program within days of the service so that content dates to August, 1997.

Around that time I also maintained an FAQ for the Afghan Whigs listserv, Congregation, but I have no idea what happened to that or where it lived. The internet of those days is like a lost civilization.

<h3>Twitter Bots</h3>
These were written in Node.js and served up on Heroku.
