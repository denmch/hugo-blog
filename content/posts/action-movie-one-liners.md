When you're the hero of an action movie, you're going to find yourself killing — or at least subduing — people in increasingly novel ways. And you can't do that unless you find a clever way to punctuate it.

So what should you say if you ever have to stab a bad guy in the throat with a paper clip?

I'm glad you asked, because I've compiled a list.

<h2>7 Things to Say in an Action Movie when Offing a Guy with a Paper Clip to the Throat</h2>

<ol>
<li>&ldquo;Get clipped!&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Don't get bent out of shape.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Keep it together.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Johnny Carson voice. &ldquo;Uh, I believe we have a clip. Is that right?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Back to basics: &ldquo;Get bent!&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Don't get too attached.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Didn't you get the memo?&rdquo;</li>
</ol>

<em>Special Bonus Zinger:</em> If the bad guy works for the IT department

- Oh, I'm sorry. Does your throat hurt? TRY TURNING IT OFF AND BACK ON AGAIN!&rdquo;

Please keep this list in mind, and don't embarrass yourself by trying to improvise.
