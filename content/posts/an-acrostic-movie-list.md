This popped up on Twitter a while back, and I realized I had to think about it a little bit. Then it got lost in drafts when I decided I'd rather write it up than get caught trying to craft a tweet like a nerd.

The idea is that you list a favorite movie for each letter in your name, so here goes.

* **Dark City** (dir. Alex Proyas, 1998)
* **Escape from New York** (dir. John Carpenter, 1981)
* **Night of the Living Dead** (dir. George A. Romero, 1968)
* **M** (dir. Fritz Lang, 1931)
* **Children of Men** (dir. Alfonso Cuar√≥n, 2006)
* **Hot Fuzz** (dir. Edgar Wright, 2007)
* **Evil Dead 2** (dir. Sam Raimi, 1987)
* **North by Northwest** (dir. Alfred Hitchcock, 1959)
* **Rushmore** (dir. Wes Anderson, 1998)
* **Young Frankenstein** (dir. Mel Brooks, 1974)

The next logical step is a list of the best movies of my lifetime. That gives me a great opportunity to start with a film that won't fit in my name: *The Killing of a Chinese Bookie* (dir. John Cassavetes, 1976). And I was going to sleep!
