Here's a new comic inspired by sketching with my son this past weekend.

<img src="/images/bear.png" alt="A bear looks out the window and thinks it looks like a lovely day, but a bit windy. He tries to put on a hat and jacket, but the jacket is too small. He paces through the house, trying to figure out who's jacket it is, then realizes it isn't even his house. The final panel shows a severed human arm on the floor.">
