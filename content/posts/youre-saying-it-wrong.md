<h4>Because my opinions are the best opinions</h4>
<p>While focusing on JavaScript to level up my web dev skills over the last several months, I’ve waged a silent war in my head over how everyone else seems to pronounce certain things.</p>
<p>Well, here at last is my declaration, and I will countenance no disagreement and no appeals to sensible arguments or respected authorities.</p>
<ul><li>var rhymes with bear, not bar</li></ul>
<figure class="wp-caption">

<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">var bear = true, bar = false;</figcaption></figure><ul>
<li>tuts rhymes with boots, not butts</li>
<li>JSON sounds like Jason, not Khe Sanh</li>
</ul>
<figure class="wp-caption">

<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Okay, let’s parse this …</figcaption></figure><ul>
<li>in regex/regexp, reg rhymes with leg, not ledge</li>
<li>names ending in -ify are consciously and playfully improper. They do not follow normal accentuation rules (i.e., not like PERson to perSONify). Browserify is BROWSer-ify, not brow-ZER-ify. JSONify is JASon-ify, not jay-SAHN-ify</li>
<li>jQuery is like, “Hey, Siri,” not “Hey, Jerry”</li>
</ul>

<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Hey, Jerry: get a job!</figcaption></figure><ul>
<li>favicon is a “fave icon” and does not sound like “have a naan” (but don’t mind if I do)</li>
<li>SQL and its derivatives are cooler pronounced “sequel” rather than “ess queue el”</li>
</ul>
<p>I know it may be difficult to break those habits, but change can happen. After decades on the wrong side of two bitter fights I finally own a Mac and pronounce gif with a soft G.</p>
